# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I'm Shreya Kamath, and I recently graduated in December 2024 with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC).  
I have a strong passion for **full-stack development** and **mobile application engineering**, and I'm currently expanding my horizons into **machine learning** and **large language models (LLMs)**.  

One principle that has always guided me is the belief that **learning is the only true constant in life** — it fuels not just my technical growth but also my excitement for tackling new challenges.  
Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams, sharing ideas, and constantly learning from different perspectives — qualities that have helped me grow not just as an engineer, but also as an effective teammate and problem solver.  

🔹 I believe great software is built at the intersection of **curiosity, collaboration, and craftsmanship**.  
🔹 I am a quick learner who thrives in fast-paced environments, consistently delivering impactful, production-ready solutions.  
🔹 My academic projects and real-world experiences have sharpened my ability to **turn ideas into scalable, user-centered applications**.

I'm excited to bring my creativity, resilience, and engineering mindset to build technologies that drive real-world impact. 🚀

## 🌟 Current Interests
I'm deeply passionate about **Full-Stack Development**, **Mobile Application Development**, **Machine Learning**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
I love creating robust, scalable backend systems, intuitive and responsive frontend interfaces, and building mobile applications that offer seamless user experiences.  
I'm fascinated by the potential of machine learning and LLMs to create intelligent, personalized, and secure applications.  
I'm excited about building privacy-first solutions, advancing AI-driven platforms, and contributing to innovative technologies that make a real-world impact.

## 🎨 My Passion
Beyond coding, I'm an artist and an avid reader!  
I love **painting** as a creative outlet and **reading books** to continuously explore new ideas and perspectives.  
For me, painting and reading complement my technical journey, helping me stay imaginative, thoughtful, and resilient.  
I believe creativity fuels better engineering, enabling me to think outside the box when designing solutions and solving complex problems.
